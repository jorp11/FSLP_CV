# FSLP_CV

This project uses and ESP32 to read pressure and position values from one or more Interlink FSLPs(Force sensitive linear potentiometers) and generate control voltage for a eurorack synthesizer. Voltages can be generated in real time or looped and played back. Documentation is currently incomplete but I'll be adding more(schematics, etc) soon.

It's written as an arduino sketch but I'll eventually port it to the ESP IDF when I have time.
